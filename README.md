# Inspiration
We wanted to help people make a positive environmental impact by indicating the little ways in which they can help the planet through their lifestyle choices.

# What it does
We are creating a website to help people keep track of their hydration and the amount of plastic that they consume. According to The Economist, only 9% of the world's plastic is recycled. By clicking the icon on the webpage, the users are able to record their hydration and be aware of how much plastic they consume.

The user inputs information about their daily life and gets statistics and visuals about how environmentally friendly they are. In this way, people can be more aware of the amount of plastic that day consume and its impact on our planet. Additionally, this website includes some sources where people can purchase refillable bottles and reusable utensils. Replacing plastic with reusable items could save the planet.

# How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and Canvas. We also used libraries such as Matplotlib and Google/jsapi for graphs and charts.

# Challenges we ran into
Integrating Python/Matplotlib into our website was complex, and we could not do it under the time constraint. We switched over to JavaScript charts to resolve this. Our Python code works independently and was a good learning experience. We also had a hard time debugging our website. Indeed, this is a great chance for us to explore different ways to make the code works. However, something happened and our code messed up.

# What we learned
This was the first hackathon for two members of the team. We learned to use GitHub and visualization(charts/graphs). We also learned to work in a culturally diverse team. Each one of us has a different background and culture. Diverse perspectives helped us improve our ideas.

# What's next for Greenie
We hope to make a more interactive and fun website and provide additional information about plastic recycling and hydration to the users. We would also add new visuals and other forms of graphs/charts to present data in a user-friendly way.
